      2. Recursion
      3. Importing libraries
   7.  Cairo on StarkNet: Interactive tutorials
      1. Cairo 101
      2. starknet-erc20 
      3. starknet-erc721
      4. starknet-messaging-bridge
      5. starknet-debug
Observations:
* Omar: 
  * The "Customizing an account contract" could be a bit too advanced for the Getting Started camp. I think it  could better go in Camp 3.
  * The "Writing a dapp", "Building a front end" and "Libraries" parts could go in Camp 2 where we teach tooling.
  * The "What is an ERC20? (starknet-erc20)" and "What is an ERC721? (starknet-erc721)" could already go inside the "Deploying an ERC20" and "Deploying an ERC721" sections.

  * Additional content was added on Modular, Finite Field and Polynomial arithmetic. Also, on the differences with SNARKs.


7. Lost & found
   Add items that were in your category, but you don't want in.
   1. "Customizing an account contract" could go in Camp 3.
   2. "Writing a dapp", "Building a front end" and "Libraries" parts could go in Camp 2 where we teach tooling.
